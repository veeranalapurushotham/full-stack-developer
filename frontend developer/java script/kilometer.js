//the question is a person is travelling from a to b with 30km/hr and he speed is double for every 10 mins and maxspeed is 120 and fint the 
//kilometer for 96 mins time 
//formula: distance=time*speed
//upto time 30per hour means 60 minutes he kilometer is 30
//after 10 minutes his speed is double means 30*10=60
//after 20 minutes his speed is double means 60*10=120
//after 30 minutes his speed is double means 120*10=240 but max speed is 120 
//after 40 minutes his speed is double means 120*10=1200 but max speed is 120
//time 10 minutes 10/60=1/6 hour
//time 6 minutes 6/60=1/10 hour
//km=30*1/6+60*1/6+120*1/6+120*1/6+120*1/6+120*1/10+120*1/10+120*601/10+120*1/10+120*1/10=167km
// so totally he travelled 167km in 96 minutes
let time=90;
 let speed=30;
let kilometer=0;
 for(let i=10;i<time;i=i+10)
{
     if(speed<120)
     {
           
     }
